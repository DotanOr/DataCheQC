# DataCheQC

A Shiny app for pefroming pharmacometrics-related quality checks (PMX QC) 

# Installation

The app can be accessed online at http://dotanor.shinyapps.io/DataCheQC

You can load the app locally by using `shiny::runGitHub("DotanOr/DataCheQC")`.

Alternatively, download the code as a .zip archive and extract the files, then run using `shiny::runApp("path/to/directory")`

<ins>**Note</ins>:**
As the app has several dependencies, running the code locally may not work right away depending on your R environment.

If you have issues with conflicting package versions, run the following to try and resolve those discrepancies:
```r
source("https://github.com/DotanOr/DataCheQC/blob/main/www/load_libs.R?raw=TRUE")
```
