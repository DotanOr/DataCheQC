# DataCheQC

A Shiny app for pefroming pharmacometrics-related quality checks (PMX QC) 

# Installation

The app can be accessed online at http://dotanor.shinyapps.io/DataCheQC

You can load the app locally by using `shiny::runGitHub("DotanOr/DataCheQC")`.

Alternatively, download the code as a .zip archive and extract the files, then run using `shiny::runApp("path/to/directory")`

**Note:** As the app has several dependencies, running the code locally may not work right away depending on your R environment.  
If you have issues with conflicting package versions, run 
```r
source("https://github.com/DotanOr/DataCheQC/blob/main/www/load_libs.R?raw=TRUE")
``` 
to try to resolve this issue.
