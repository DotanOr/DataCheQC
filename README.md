# DataCheQC
A Shiny app for pefroming pharmacometrics-related quality checks (PMX QC) 

# Installation
The app can be accessed online at http://dotanor.shinyapps.io/DataCheQC

You can load the app locally by using shiny::runGitHub("DotanOr/DataCheQC").

Alternatively, download the code as a .zip archive and extract the files, then run using shiny::runApp("path/to/directory")

Note that the app has several dependencies, which means the code may not work right away. If you have issues with conflicting package versions, run source("") to try to resolve this issue.
