## Overview

> **DataCheQC** is an interactive application based on the **R Shiny** framework developed for the purposes of performing quality control (QC) checks on pharmacometrics datasets, and thereby supporting the implementation of model-informed drug development.
>
> Features include **visual inspection** of variables and data entries for errors and/or anomalies, and **ensuring structural integrity** through comparison with a dataset specification file.
>
> The open-source app, which requires no programming knowledge to operate, also allows the user to collect all findings into a **summary QC Report** which can be downloaded directly from the app.

## The QC Workflow

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Dataset and Specification Format](input_format.html){style="color: #2d2d2d"}

-   A Generalized Format for both dataset and specification file

-   Allows app outputs to be software-agnostic

-   Enables working with multiple file types (.csv, .sas7bdat, .doc, .xlsx)

### [Data Handling](data_handling.html){style="color: #2d2d2d"}

-   Automatic detection of doses, observations, and covariates
-   Impute missing continuous covariate values
-   Run data cleaning functions on the dataset

<br>

### [Dataset Quality Checks](dataset_qc.html){style="color: #2d2d2d"}

-   Compare the dataset to the specification file's general table
-   Compare dataset observations with the specification file's event table
-   Filter out optional variables
-   Check for missing or incorrectly defined values
-   Check that corresponding columns aligned (e.g., Time and Nominal Time, Cohort and Dose, Value and Unit)
-   Collect all findings into an editable QC report
-   Download the final report as a *.docx* document
-   Continue previous work by loading a pre-existing interim report

<br>

### [Data Visualization and Summary Tables](eda_st.html){style="color: #2d2d2d"}

-   For Each Observation:

    -   Spaghetti Plots
    -   Median Range Plots
    -   Individual Plots

-   For Continuous/Categorical Covariates:

    -   Covariate Distribution
    -   Covariate Correlations

-   For Timings:

    -   Plots comparing Nominal vs Actual Time
    -   Dosing Schedule plots
    -   Sampling Schedule Plots

-   Summary Tables:

    -   Summary of Continuous & Categorical Covariates
    -   Summary of Duplicated Time-Value Pairs
    -   Summary of Observations

-   All of the above can be downloaded separately or all together as .zip archive which will be built in the background

-   Hover over the info icon - ![](www/circle-info-solid.svg "Hover over me for more info!"){#hover-icon margin-bottom="3px" width="21"} - which appears next to most features to show an informative tooltip about that feature and what to look for during QC.

## Getting Started

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To app is freely available online on [shinyapps.io](https://dotanor.shinyapps.io/DataCheQC/) and its source code is hosted as a public repository on [Github](https://github.com/DotanOr/DataCheQC).

<br>

#### Local Installation

If you wish to run a local version of the app, run the following line in your R IDE:

```{r first-local-option, eval=FALSE, results='asis'}
shiny::runGitHub("DotanOr/DataCheQC")
```

Alternatively, you can download the code as a .zip archive and extract the files, then run the app using:

```{r second-local-option, eval=FALSE, results='asis'}
shiny::runApp("path/to/directory")
```

<strong style= "text-decoration: underline">Note:</strong>\
As the app has several dependencies, running the code locally may not work right away depending on your R environment.

If you have issues with conflicting package versions, run the following to try and resolve those discrepancies:

``` {.r}
source("https://github.com/DotanOr/DataCheQC/blob/main/www/load_libs.R?raw=TRUE")
```
