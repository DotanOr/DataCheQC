## Overview

> **DataCheQC** is an interactive application based on the **R Shiny** framework developed for the purposes of performing quality control (QC) checks on pharmacometrics datasets, and thereby supporting the implementation of model-informed drug development.  Features include visual inspection of variables and data entries for errors and/or anomalies, and ensuring structural integrity through comparison with a dataset specification file.  The open-source app, which requires no programming knowledge to operate, also allows the user to collect all findings into a summary report which can be downloaded directly from the app.

## The QC Workflow
 ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111221177/227787492-d4a40cfe-94fd-4aa3-99eb-7e64d49cac84.png)

## Features
### Data Handling
  * Automatic detection of doses, observations, and covariates
  * Impute missing continuous covariate values
  * Run data cleaning functions on the dataset
  
### Dataset Quality Checks:
* Compare the dataset to the specification file's general table
* Compare dataset observations with the specification file's event table
* Filter out optional variables
* Check for missing or incorrectly defined values
* Check that corresponding columns aligned (e.g., Time and Nominal Time, Cohort and Dose, Value and Unit)
* Collect all findings into an editable QC report
* Download the final report as a _.docx_ document
* Continue previous work by loading a pre-existing interim report

### Data Visualization and Summary Tables:
* For Each Observation:
  + Spaghetti Plots
  + Median Range Plots
  + Individual Plots
* For Continuous/Categorical Covariates:
  + Covariate Distribution
  + Covariate Correlations
* For Timings:
  + Plots comparing Nominal vs Actual Time
  + Dosing Schedule plots
  + Sampling Schedule Plots
* Summary Tables:
  + Summary of Continuous & Categorical Covariates
  + Summary of Duplicated Time-Value Pairs
  + Summary of Observations
* All of the above can be downloaded separately or all together as .zip archive which will be built in the background


## Getting Started

To app is freely available online on [shinyapps.io](https://dotanor.shinyapps.io/DataCheQC/) and its source code is hosted as a public repository on [Github](https://github.com/DotanOr/DataCheQC).

### Local Installation

If you wish to run a local version of the app, run the following line in your R IDE:

```{r eval=FALSE, results='asis'}
shiny::runGitHub("DotanOr/DataCheQC")
```

Alternatively, you can download the code as a .zip archive and extract the files, then run the app using: 
```{r eval=FALSE, results='asis'}
shiny::runApp("path/to/directory")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
